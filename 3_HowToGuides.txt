- \subpage seg_SNAP "ITK-SNAP"
- \subpage seg_DL "Deep Learning Segmentation"

*/


/**

\page seg_GeoTrain Geodesic Training Segmentation

'GeodesicTraining' builds upon the geodesic distance based segmentation by using machine learning (SVMs) [1]. 

It also adds support for multiple areas of interest, multiple modalities, the ability to iterate the algorithm until a desired outcome is achieved and no need for thresholding. 

<b> REQUIREMENTS:</b>
One or more co-register images of the same subject. A ROI image has to be drawn which will containing sample labels for the different areas the user wants to segment (see usage for details). 

<b> USAGE:</b>
	-# Load the different images, that are different modalities of the same subject into CaPTk. It doesn't matter which image you have selected from the ones that are loaded. Everything that is loaded is passed to the algorithm.
	-# Draw over the images using CaPTk's drawing tools. Example: Suppose that you have an image of a brain tumor and you are interested in segmenting the image into 3 different sections, tumor core (the main tumor), edema (a fluid surrounding the tumor core) and healthy tissue (the reset of the brain). You have to use three different colors. Suppose you use RED for tumor core, GREEN for edema and BLUE for healthy tissue (it's up to you to pick the colors). Draw a little bit over the tumor core with the red marker, a little bit over the edema with the green one and a little bit anywhere else that is not an affected area with the blue marker. Keep in mind to always use a color for areas that are not of interest (like we used now for healthy tissue), otherwise the algorithm will try to classify the healthy tissue as one of the colors you have actually drawn. Obviously, whatever you do you have to use at least two different colors. You don't need to draw excessively. In fact it is advised not to go overboard, as this leaves you room for better corrections later on (see below). It's best to stick to the free-hand drawing tool with 1x1 or 3x3 marker size.
	-# After you have drawn, Click Applications>'Geodesic Training Segmentation' from the menu and wait ~30 seconds (depends on the number of images, the images' size and your computer specs).
	-# Now you will see the output segmentation where your labels were previously drawn. You can keep this segmentation if it's ok. Chances are though that it contains mistakes. Using the drawing tools again, draw over *some* of those mistakes (right on the output segmentation!) and then click Applications>'Geodesic Training Segmentation' again. You can repeat this as many times as you want. (There probably won't be a need for more than 2-3 runs though). Something that you might not know about about CaPTk is that you can change the opacity of the ROI by clicking an image, then the 'opacity' checkbox next to the same image and using the slider.
	-# Once you are satisfied with the segmentation you can save it using File>Save>ROI. Most of the time people don't want their segmentations to contain labels for the healthy tissue. If you wish for something similar then, before saving, select the color you used for healthy tissues from the 'label selector' in the drawing tools and click 'Clear selected label' and save.
	- This application is also available as with a stand-alone CLI for data analysts to build pipelines around, and can run in the following format:
\verbatim
${CaPTk_InstallDir}/bin/GeodesicTraining.exe -i C:/inputImage1.nii.gz,C:/inputImage2.nii.gz,... -l C:/maskWithAtLeastTwoDifferentClasses.nii.gz -o C:/outputDirectoryNotFilename
\endverbatim
	
	You have to draw the ROI image somewhere else to use the CLI executable. This image should be zero everywhere, except for the voxels that you have drawn. These voxels should be the same value if they belong to the same area. For instance in the example we discussed before, you can use value 1 for tumor core, value 2 for edema and value 3 for healthy tissue. If you don't want the output to contain the healthy tissue you can use parameter "-cl 3/0" which means that value 3 will be changed to 0. Keep in mind that values for healthy tissue are still needed, they just not going to show up in the output segmentation. If you want to iterate (correct mistakes in the segmentation), it's a bit harder to do with the CLI. You have to add new values to the input ROI (not the output segmentation) and run again. If you are going to use the CLI it is recommended to spend a little bit more time when you draw your input ROI so the first segmentation you get is good and you don't have to iterate the algorithm often.

/**
\page ht_FeatureExtraction Feature Extraction
<b>REQUIREMENTS:</b>
  -# An image or a set of co-registered images.
  -# An ROI file containing various labels, for which features will be extracted.
 
<b>USAGE:</b>
  -# Once image(s) and an ROI file are loaded, go to the "Feature Extraction" panel.
  -# In the "Customization" section, you can select one of the preset of features to extract from the drop-down menu:
    - <b>Custom</b>: allows the manual selection & customization of specific features.
    - <b>Custom_Lattice</b>: allows the manual selection & customization of specific features using a lattice-based strategy for feature extraction [1]. A regular lattice is virtually overlaid on the ROI and features are computed on local square (for 2D images) or cubic (for 3D images) regions centered on each lattice point. The final feature estimates are then calculated as summary statistics of the corresponding feature measurements across all regions defined by the lattice. The parameterization of the lattice is described in the <a href="tr_Apps.html#appsFeatures">Technical Reference</a> section.
    - <b>Lung_SBRT</b>: enables the extraction of features that are used in [2].
  -# For the "Custom" and "Custom_lattice" presets, and once specific features are selected, you can use the <b>Advanced</b> button (in "Customization") to parameterize further the individual selected features.
  -# In the <b>Image Selection</b> section, you can select the radio button of "<b>Selected Image</b>" or "<b>All Images</b>" to extract features for either the visualized image or all the images loaded in CaPTk, respectively.
  -# In the <b>Mask Selection</b> section, you have the option to define the label number(s) for which you want to extract features. Note that when more than one label number is entered the 'pipe' symbol should be used as a separator, i.e. |. Equivalently, text labels should be provided corresponding to each label number, again separated by a 'pipe'.
  -# Once the output CSV file is defined you can click on <b>Compute + Save</b>. (Note that the CSV file should be in ASCII format)
  -# For the command line interface, a user can copy the file <b>${CaPTk_Installation_Folder}/data/features/1_params_default.csv</b> to a location where they would have write access, change the parameters as they see fit and then pass that to the CLI under the "-b" parameter (example shown below).
  - This application is also available as with a stand-alone CLI for data analysts to build pipelines around, and can run in the following format:
\verbatim
${CaPTk_InstallDir}/bin/FeatureExtraction.exe -n AAC0_timestamp -i /usr/path/T1.nii.gz,/usr/path/T2.nii.gz -t T1,T2 -m /user/path/mask.nii.gz -r 2,4,5 -l ED,EN,NE -p /usr/path/features.csv -o /usr/path/output.csv
\endverbatim
  
  -# Batch processing is also available (for more details, please see the relevant <a href="tr_FeatureExtraction.html#tr_fe_batch">technical reference</a> page):
\verbatim
${CaPTk_InstallDir}/bin/FeatureExtraction.exe -b /usr/path/batch.csv -p /usr/path/features.csv -o /usr/path/output.csv
\endverbatim

  -# As intermediate results of the "Custom_lattice", the user also has the option to save feature maps, i.e., images that represent the spatial distribution of the corresponding feature measurements as sampled by the lattice over the ROI, using the following CLI format:
\verbatim
${CaPTk_InstallDir}/bin/FeatureExtraction.exe -n AAC0_timestamp -i /usr/path/T1.nii.gz,/usr/path/T2.nii.gz -t T1,T2 -m /user/path/mask.nii.gz -r 2,4,5 -l ED,EN,NE -p /usr/path/features.csv -o /usr/path/output.csv -f 1
\endverbatim

The above command extracts features defined in the parameter file defined in "-p" for the input images defined in "-i" in the regions defined in "-m" and "-r". The output is populated using the subject ID from "-n", modality information from "-t" and annotation label information from "-l" and saves the results in the path defined in "-o".
  
  -# For more information on the defaults of the feature extraction and how to customize it, please see our <a href="tr_FeatureExtraction.html#tr_fe_defaults">technical reference</a> page.
  
  -# The output of Feature Extraction can be used to run the <a href="Training_Module.html">Training Module</a>.

/**  
\page Glioblastoma_PHI Brain Cancer: Glioblastoma EGFRvIII Surrogate Index (PHI Estimator)
This application evaluates the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor splice variant III (EGFRvIII) status in primary glioblastoma, by quantitative pattern analysis of the spatial heterogeneity of peritumoral perfusion dynamics from Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast (DSC) MRI scans, through the Peritumoral Heterogeneity Index (PHI / &phi;-index) [1-3].

<b>REQUIREMENTS:</b>
	-# T1-Gd: To annotate the immediate peritumoral ROI.
	-# T2-FLAIR: To annotate the distant peritumoral ROI.
	-# DSC-MRI: To perform the analysis and extract the PHI.
  -# (Command-line only) ROI Label file consisting of near-region (Label=1) and far-region (Label=2)
 
<b>USAGE:</b>
	-# Annotate 2 ROIs: one near (Label:1) the enhancing tumor and another far (Label:2) from it (but still within the peritumoral region). Rules for ROI annotation are provided below [3].
	-# Once the 2 ROIs are annotated, the application can be launched by using the menu option: 'Applications -> EGFRvIII Surrogate Index'.
	-# A pop-up window appears displaying the results (within <1 minute).
	- This application is also available as with a stand-alone CLI for data analysts to build pipelines around, using the following example command:
\verbatim
${CaPTk_InstallDir}/bin/EGFRvIIISurrogateIndex.exe -i C:/inputDSCImage.nii.gz -m C:/maskWithNearAndFarLabels.nii.gz
\endverbatim

<b>RULES FOR ROI ANNOTATION</b>:
  - These two ROIs are used to sample tissue located on the two boundaries of the peritumoaral edema/invasion area: near to and far from the tumor, respectively, and hence to evaluate the heterogeneity or spatial gradient of perfusion signals [1-3].
  - The "near" ROI is initially defined in the T1-Gd volume, adjacent to the enhancing part of the tumor, described by hyperintense signal on T1-Gd. The T2-FLAIR volume is then used to revise this ROI in terms of all its voxels being within the peritumoral edematous tissue, described by hyperintense signal on the T2-FLAIR volume.
  - The T2-FLAIR volume is also used to define the ROI at the farthest from the tumor but still within the edematous tissue, i.e., the enhancing FLAIR abnormality signal.
  - These ROIs are described by lines drawn in multiple slices of each image (T1-Gd and T2-FLAIR) for each subject.
  - Please note that during annotation:
    - Both ROIs are always within the peritumoral edema/invasion area,
    - None of the ROIs are in proximity to the ventricles,
    - Both ROIs are representative of infiltration into white matter and not into gray matter,
    - The distant ROI is at the farthest possible distance from the enhancing part of the tumor while still within edema, and 
    - No vessels are involved within any of the defined ROIs, as denoted in the T1-Gd volume.

/**
\page Glioblastoma_Confetti Brain Cancer: Confetti

This is a method for automated extraction of white matter tracts of interest in a consistent and comparable manner over a large group of subjects without drawing the inclusion and exclusion ROIs, facilitating an easy correspondence between different subjects, as well as providing a representation that is robust to edema, mass effect, and tract infiltration [1-3]. Confetti includes three main steps: 
-# Connectivity signature generation for fibers
-# Clustering of fibers using a mixture of multinomials (MNs) clustering method and Expectation-Maximization (EM) optimization framework
-# Extraction of predefined white matter tracts. 

<b>REQUIREMENTS:</b>
	-# Fiber set (Streamline) to be clustered: The fiber set can be generated using any tractography model, but the file should be saved in .Bfloat format (i.e. fiber format of Camino package). Different converters can be be used to convert .trk to .Bfloat and vice-versa.
	-# Track Density Images (TDI): When using GUI, it needs to be generated in the manner explained below; this constraint is not present when using Confetti via the command line.
	-# Parcellation of the brain into 87 Desikan/Freesurfer gray matter (GM) regions [4]

	<b>Generation of TDI Images with GUI:</b>
	-# Freesurfer [4] is used with the Desikan atlas [5] to define 87 gray matter ROIs in the user diffusion space. 
	-# Region IDs of the ROIs as used by Freesurfer is provided in the example file "{CaPTk_Sample_Data}/Confetti/input/freesurfer_ROIs.csv". (Note that the CSV file should be in ASCII format)
	-# TDIs must be generated using the probtrackx utility of FSL package [6] with its default parameters and 5000 seeds per voxel. 
	-# Each TDI image is a whole brain voxel-map, with each voxel having the number of fibers passing through this voxel and reaching to one of the 87 gray matter ROIs defined by Freesurfer. 
	-# In total, you should have 87 TDI, each corresponding to one ROI. 

<b>USAGE:</b>
	-# Open Confetti UI using the 'Applications -> Confetti' menu option.
	-# Load the required images using "Streamline File" and "TDI Directory".
	-# Specify the output directory and click on 'Run Confetti'.
	-# Visually review the output tracks by double clicking respective fields on the populated list view.
	- This application is also available as with a stand-alone CLI for data analysts to build pipelines around, using the following example commands:
	-# Generation of connectivity signatures of the fibers that will be clustered into bundles:
\verbatim
${CaPTk_InstallDir}/bin/Confetti signature -i tdi_paths_freesurfer_87ROIs.csv -f fibers.Bfloat -o signatures.csv
\endverbatim
	-# Clustering of the generated fibers into bundles:
\verbatim
${CaPTk_InstallDir}/bin/Confetti cluster -s signatures.csv -k 200 -o clusterIDs.csv
\endverbatim
	-# Identification of specific tracts (requires an annotated example):
\verbatim
${CaPTk_InstallDir}/bin/Confetti extract -t template/ -f fibers.Bfloat -c clusterIDs.csv -o tracts_
\endverbatim

/**
\page Glioblastoma_Directionality Miscellaneous: Directionality Estimator

This application estimates the volumetric changes and their directionality for a given ROI across two timepoints [1] and also returns the projections of the boundary point with the maximum distance from a seedpoint (with label <b>TU</b>) in each of the 3 2D visualized planes. 
	
<b> REQUIREMENTS:</b>
	-# The image of timepoint 1 and a tissue seedpoint with label <b>TU</b> within the ROI at timepoint 1.
	-# [OPTIONAL] If the second time point image is not perfectly aligned, a second tissue seedpoint with label <b>NCR</b> can be initialized and the algorithm will take that translation into consideration during computation.
	-# Two ROI files, one for each timepoint (note that the populated voxels of the ROIs should be of Label 1).

<b> USAGE:</b>
	-# Load the image of timepoint 1 in CaPTk and initialize the (or load an already initialized) seedpoint with label <b>TU</b> defining the point within the ROI from where you want to estimate the expansion. 
  -# [OPTIONAL] Load the image of timepoint 2 in CaPTk and initialize the (or load an already initialized) seedpoint with label <b>NCR</b> defining the point within the ROI from where you want to estimate the expansion. 
	-# Launch the Directionality Estimator application using the 'Applications -> Directionality Estimator' menu option.
	-# Specify the Input ROI files for the 2 timepoints and the Output directory where the output masks and text files will be saved.
	-# Click on 'Confirm" and a pop-up window will be displayed showing the total volumetric change, as well as the change per 3D octant. 
	-# A parametric map is automatically loaded as an image in the visualization panels of CaPTk dividing the ROI of timepoint 1 in octants and assigning a value in the range [0,1] on each octant. Smaller and larger values represent the octants with smaller and larger relative volumetric change.
	-# A multi-label map is also automatically loaded as an ROI in the visualization panels of CaPTk depicting with i) label 1 (red) and label 3 (yellow) the intersection of the timepoint 1 and timepoint 2 ROIs, ii) label 3 (yellow) the octant of maximum expansion, and iii) label 2 (green) the voxels of expansion in timepoint 2, i.e. the voxels that did not exist in the timepoint 1 ROI but only in the ROI of timepoint 2. Note that the visualization of the multi-label map can be controlled from the "Drawing" panel.
	-# Tissue point table gets updated with 3 points marked "CSF" (which are correspond to the direction of max point along the different planes) and 1 point marked "RTN" (which is the actual 3D point of max distance from initialized seed point).
	-# The results as well as the actual distances are automatically saved in a text file in the Output folder together with the multi-label ROI images.
	-# The user can save both the actual and the projection points of max distance in a location of their choosing.
	- This application is also available as with a stand-alone CLI for data analysts to build pipelines around, using the following example command:
\verbatim

- <b>roi_DE_octantImage.nii.gz</b>, which describes the partitioned version of timepoint_2_ROI in octants with the corresponding numbering of octants accompanying the numbering included in the output text file. 
- <b>roi_DE_visualizationRatio.nii.gz</b>, which describes the ratio of the timepoint_2_ROI over timepoint_1_ROI of the volumetric differences per octant.
- <b>roiDE_visualizationProbability.nii.gz</b>, which describes the parametric map dividing the ROI of timepoint 1 in octants and assigning a value in the range [0,1] on each octant. Smaller and larger values represent the octants with smaller and larger relative volumetric change. This is the same result as roi_DE_visualizationRatio.nii.gz but scaled between 0 and 1.
- <b>roi_DE_visualizationIncrease.nii.gz</b>, which describes the multi-label map depicting the intersection of the timepoint 1 and timepoint 2 ROIs using i) label 1 (red) and label 3 (yellow), ii) the octant of maximum expansion based on distance and not based on volumetric difference using label 4 (blue), and iii) the voxels of expansion in timepoint 2, i.e. the voxels that did not exist in the timepoint 1 ROI but only in the ROI of timepoint 2 using label 2 (green).

/**
\page BreastCancer_LIBRA Breast Cancer: Breast Density Estimation (LIBRA)
The Laboratory for Individualized Breast Radiodensity Assessment (LIBRA) is a software application for fully-automated breast density segmentation in full-field digital mammography (FFDM) [1]. LIBRA is available in single and batch mode. 

<b>REQUIREMENTS:</b>
	- Raw (i.e., "FOR PROCESSING") or vendor post-processed (i.e., "FOR PRESENTATION") FFDM images.
	- FFDM vendors currently supported: GE Healthcare and Hologic.
	- For single mode: Each image stored in a separate folder.
	- For batch mode: All images stored in a single folder.
	
<b>USAGE:</b>
- Single mode:
	-# Load the FFDM image using the 'File -> Load -> Images' menu option.
	-# Launch LIBRA using the 'Applications -> LIBRA_SingleImage' menu option.
	-# LIBRA is executed and the segmentation mask is automatically loaded back to CaPTk. 
	-# LIBRA outputs (described in the Outputs section below) are automatically saved in a temp folder under the CaPTk directory.
- Batch mode:
	-# Launch LIBRA using the 'Applications -> LIBRA_BatchMode' menu option.
	-# The user is prompted to select the folder which contains the images for analysis.
	-# The user is then prompted to select an output folder where the density scores and density segmentation images .jpg files will be stored. Note: If the folder already exists and contains density estimates (e.g., from a previous run of LIBRA), it will append the new results to the results file.
	-# Lastly, the user will be asked whether they wish to store a processing log file and intermediate graphics in addition to the density segmentation outline which may be on interest for publication or visualization purposes, and are further described in the Outputs section below.
	-# LIBRA will then begin processing all the FFDM images; the progress of the software can be monitored via the related command-prompt window that opens when LIBRA starts running. When analysis is complete, a prompt appears asking the user if they want to open the results folder and if they want to perform additional analyses.

<b>OUTPUT:</b>
- The following outputs are always generated:
	- Masks_<Image-Analyzed>.mat: A MATLAB datafile containing a structure array that stores the breast area (res.BreastArea), dense area (res.DenseArea), and area percent density estimates (res.PD_SVM) for the FFDM analyzed (res.dcm_fname). This structure array also stores the binary masks of the breast (res.BreastMask) and dense tissue segmentations (res.DenseMask), which may be useful for further processing and analysis.
	- Density.csv: A comma separated file (open-able by spreadsheet programs like Excel) that stores the breast area, dense area, and percent density estimates for each FFDM image analyzed, listed by file name. The Manufacturer, Laterality and View-Position of the mammogram are also provided for reference. (Note that the CSV file should be in ASCII format)
	- <Image-Analyzed-Filename>_density_segmentation.jpg: In the Result_Images sub-directory, the breast and density segmentation results are provided for each image analyzed. The breast is outlined in red, the density segmentation is in green. Note that for visualization purposes, the image is window-leveled to between the 5th and 95th percentile of the intensity values of the pixels within the breast region.
- In single mode the following outputs are generated by default, while in batch mode they are only generated if the user specifies to save intermediate files:
	- LIBRA-logfile_<time-stamp>.txt: A log of the programs outputs during the session, this text file is time-stamped at the start of the LIBRA sessions so that multiple sessions writing to the same output folder each have their own unique log of events. The <time-stamp> takes the form of <Month>-<DD>-<YYYY>_HH-MM-SS, in 24-hour format. .. _fig_log_file.
	- <Image-Analyzed-Filename>_Windowed_Original.jpg: In the Result_Images sub-directory, the analyzed image window-leveled to between the 5th and 95th percentile of the intensity values of the pixels within the breast region is also provided with out the breast density segmentation overlay for comparison purposes.
	- <Image-Analyzed>_density_imagesc.jpg: In the Result_Images sub-directory, the image clusters (grouped by colors) generated by the Fuzzy C-Means stage of the LIBRA algorithm is provided.
	- <Image-Analyzed>_intensity_histogram.jpg: In the Result_Images sub-directory, the breast intensity histogram (z-scored) and FCM-cluster centers are plotted in this image.
  - Please see the LIBRA manual for more details: https://www.med.upenn.edu/sbia/libra.html

<b> REQUIREMENTS:</b>
  -# A single DSC-MRI image 
  -# Its corresponding mask for which the measurements need to be extracted

<b> USAGE:</b>
	-# Load a DSC-MRI in CaPTk and the mask (Label:1) defining the voxels to extract the measurements.
  -# Launch the application from "Applications" -> "PCA Volume Extraction".
  -# Specify the number of principal components required and the output directory.
	-# Press the "Confirm" button.
	-# The principal components will be extracted at the specified location and also loaded in CaPTk (~5 minutes).

- This application is also available as with a stand-alone CLI for data analysts to build pipelines around, using the following example commands:
  - The following command will train a new model based on the samples in the inputDir using 5 principal components:
	\verbatim
${CaPTk_InstallDir}/bin/PerfusionPCA.exe -t 0 -i C:/properly/formatted/inputDir -o C:/outputDir -n 5
	\endverbatim
  - The following command will perform inference using an existing model for inputs in C:/input based on C:/modelDir using 5 principal components:
	\verbatim
${CaPTk_InstallDir}/bin/PerfusionPCA.exe -t 1 -i C:/properly/formatted/inputDir -m C:/inputModelDir -o C:/outputDir -n 5
	\endverbatim

\page Training_Module Miscellaneous: Training Module
This application allows training/testing using Support Vector Machine

<b> REQUIREMENTS:</b>
Input features file (CSV) and a target label file (CSV).

<b> USAGE:</b>parameterize
	-# Launch the application from "Applications" -> "Training Module".
	-# Specify the features (.csv) file and the corresponding target (.csv) file.
	-# Specify the kernel of SVM using either of the two radio buttons. 
	-# Specify the cross-validation method which could be either k-fold cross-validation, split-train-test, training only, or inference only.
	-# In case of k-fold cross-validation, specify the number of folds in the corresponding edit box. In case of split-train-test method, specify the number of training samples X. The starting X entries (out of the total N) of the feature and target file will be used for training and the remaining n-X entries will be used for testing. For training only option, no additional parameter is required in 'Configuration' section. For testing only option, the directory containing the trained model files should be provided. 
	-# Press "Confirm" button. 
	-# The model or the predicted output, depending on the configuration, will be calculated and saved in the output directory.
	- This application is also available as with a stand-alone CLI for data analysts to build pipelines around, and can run in the following formats:
    - K-Fold CrossValidation option:
		\verbatim
${CaPTk_InstallDir}/bin/TrainingModule -f C:/TestFeatures.csv -l C:/TestLabels.csv -o C:/OutputDirectory -c 1 -n 1 -k 10 
		\endverbatim
    - Split Train-Test option:
		\verbatim
${CaPTk_InstallDir}/bin/TrainingModule -f C:/TestFeatures.csv -l C:/TestLabels.csv -o C:/OutputDirectory -c 1 -n 2 -k 40
		\endverbatim
    - Train only option:
		\verbatim
${CaPTk_InstallDir}/bin/TrainingModule -f C:/TestFeatures.csv -l C:/TestLabels.csv -o C:/OutputDirectory -c 1 -n 3 -k 10
