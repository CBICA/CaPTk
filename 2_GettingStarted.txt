\section gs_supportedImages Supported Images
Currently, CaPTk supports visualization of <b>MR, CT, PET, X-Ray and Full-field Digital Mammography (FFDM) </b> images in NIfTI (i.e., <b>.nii</b>, <b>.nii.gz</b>) format.  DICOM (i.e., <b>.dcm</b>) support is limited to a few protocols for MR, CT and MG modalities. In NIfTI format, for MRI, the following modalities are currently supported (the image modality box equivalent is shown in parenthesis):

|   Acronym   |                               Image Type                              |

\section gs_imageLoading Image & Mask Loading
The <b>File -> Load -> Images</b> menu is used to load all image types. Images can also be loaded by dragging and dropping onto the application. In case of DICOM images, loading/dragging a single image loads the entire dicom series. 
<br>
Mask must be loaded via <b>File -> Load -> ROI</b> menu.

\image html imageLoading_resize.png "Loading images & mask for visualization/processing"
\image latex imageLoading_resize.png "Loading images & mask for visualization/processing"

--------
For every loaded NIfTI image, the modality is automatically assigned using information from the filename. To <b> assign modalities </b> for DICOM images, or in case of a discrepancy in the modality of a NIfTI image, the user can use the drop-down modality switcher (see below) to revise the modality accordingly. This is typically needed in the <a href="ht_SpecialApps.html">Specialized Applications</a>.

\image html modalities_resize.png "Modality switching for individual images"
\image latex modalities_resize.png "Modality switching for individual images"

--------

\section gs_imageVisualization Image Visualization
Sliders on each visualization panel (highlighted in green in the figure below) control the movement across respective axes. Note that in DSC-MRI, the single horizontal slider (highlighted in yellow) moves across the time of the acquired dynamic scan.
<br>
Various adjustments are available to the user, including:
-# Window/Level: right mouse button press + horizontal/vertical mouse move on any visualization panel, respectively.
-# Manual Window/Level and setting of different visualization presets: bottom-right panel.
-# Image zoom: Ctrl + mouse wheel.
-# Image pan: Ctrl + left mouse button press + mouse move.

The bottom-left panel of CaPTk (highlighted in red) shows basic information about the image and the position of the cross-hair. In the visualization panes, the "Z" axis is the center; and "Y" and "X" are to its left and right, respectively. "Z" represents the Axial view for RAI-to-LPS images. 


\image html sliders_resize.png "Visualization Sliders and Image Information"
\image latex sliders_resize.png "Visualization Sliders and Image Information"


The "Overlay" functionality enables the visualization between two loaded images:

-# Double-click one of the two images you want to visualize and then click on its corresponding "overlay" radio button, on its right-most column.
-# Click on the "overlay" radio button of the second image that you want to visualize.
-# Both "Overlay" and "Underlay" images are now visualized with 50% opacity.
-# Check the tick box "Change Opacity".
-# Moving the slider changes the opacity between the "Overlay" and the "Underlay" images.


The "Comparison Mode" puts the loaded images (3 maximum) side-by-side for easy visualization along the same axis.

\image html comparisonMode.png "Comparison Mode visualization"
\image latex comparisonMode.png "Comparison Mode visualization"

--------

\section gs_tabDocking Tab Docking
Double clicking on the tab bar will dock/undock the entire section, resulting in larger visualization panels in your monitor. This behavior is replicated by single click of the dock/undock button at the end of the section as well.

\image html dock_comparison_resize.png "Left is while dock is active and right is undocked behavior"

\section gs_seedpoints Coordinate definition (Seed-point initialization)
The <b>Seed Points</b> tab includes two general types of initialization (i.e., tumor and tissue points), controlled by the respective radio buttons. 

\image html seeds_resize.png "Seed point initialization"
\image latex seeds_resize.png "Seed point initialization"

Loading and saving is done via text files in a format consistent with respective applications. Seedpoint files are needed for the following applications (and all derivatives): GLISTR (https://www.cbica.upenn.edu/sbia/software/glistr/) [1-3], GLISTRboost (BraTS 2015 top-ranked algorithm - https://www.med.upenn.edu/sbia/glistrboost.html) [4-6], and PORTR (https://www.cbica.upenn.edu/sbia/software/portr/) [7].

The controls to add/remove points are the shown below.

--------
\subsection gs_seedpoints_tumor Tumor Points
These are seed-points used to approximate a tumor by a parametric spherical model, using a seed-point for its center and another for defining its radius. These are helpful for applications like tumor growth model estimation as currently incorporated in GLISTR and GLISTRboost. The controls are as follows:

|    Key Stroke   |                               Function/Action                              |
|:---------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|  Shift + Space  |                    [SEED POINT] Set initial tumor center                   |
| Control + Space | [SEED POINT] Update tumor radius; on macOS, this is "Fn + Command + Space" |
|      Space      |                      [SEED POINT] Update tumor center                      |

--------
\subsection gs_seedpoints_tissue Tissue Points
These are seed-points with coordinate information. They can be used for a multitude of applications where manual initialization(s) are required for a semi-automated algorithm, e.g, segmentation. At the moment these points are being assigned various brain tissue labels, as follows:

| Tissue Acronym |            Full Form            |
|:--------------:|:-------------------------------:|
|       CSF      |       Cerebrospinal Fluid       |
|       VT       | Ventricular Cerebrospinal Fluid |
|       GM       |           Gray Matter           |
|       WM       |           White Matter          |
|       VS       |             Vessels             |
|       ED       |              Edema              |
|       NCR      |             Necrosis            |
|       ET       |         Enhancing Tumor         |
|       NE       |       Non-Enhancing Tumor       |
|       CB       |            Cerebellum           |
|       CAE      |         Enhancing Cavity        |
|       CAN      |       Non-Enhancing Cavity      |
|       RTN      |         Tumor Recurrence        |
|       RTE      |    Enhanced Tumor Recurrence    |

--------
Application-specific tissue types are automatically enabled when the corresponding application is selected. For example, when trying to initialize tissue points for GLISTR/GLISTRboost, only CSF, GM, WM, VS, ED, NCR, TU, NE and CB buttons will be enabled and the rest will be disabled. If there are some required tissue types missing for an application, CaPTk will display a warning and not let the user save an incomplete set of tissue points.

\section gs_utilities Utilities (Command-line only)

To make pipeline construction using CaPTk easier, a bunch of utilities have been provided. They include 
-# Resizing
-# DICOM conversion
-# Sanity checking
-# Image header information
-# Unique values in image
-# Changing pixel values. 

For full details, run the command:

\verbatim
Utilities.exe -u
\endverbatim

\section gs_preprocessing Pre-processing
Image pre-processing is essential to quantitative image analysis. CaPTk pre-processing tools available under the "Preprocessing" menu are fully-parameterizable and comprise:

   -<b>Denoising.</b> Intensity noise reduction in regions of uniform intensity profile is offered through a low-level image processing method, namely Smallest Univalue Segment Assimilating Nucleus (SUSAN) [1]. This is a custom implementation and does <b>NOT</b> call out to the original implementation distributed by FSL.
   -<b>Co-registration.</b> Registration of various images to the same anatomical template, for examining anatomically aligned imaging signals in tandem and at the voxel level, is done using the Greedy Registration algorithm [5].
   -<b>Bias correction.</b> Correction for magnetic field inhomogeneity is provided using a non-parametric non-uniform intensity normalization [2].
   -<b>Intensity normalization.</b> Conversion of signals across modalities to comparable quantities using histogram matching [4].
   -<b>Z-Scoring normalization.</b> Images are normalized using a z-scoring mechanism with option to do the normalization within the region of interest or across the entire image. In addition, there is an option to remove outliers & noise from the image by removing a certain percentage of the top and bottom intensity ranges [6].
   -<b>Histogram Matching</b>
   -<b>Skull Stripping (Deep Learning based)</b>
   -<b>Mammogram Pre-processing</b>


<B>NOTE:</B> An extended set of algorithms are available via the command line utility <b>Preprocessing</b>. For full details, run the command:

\verbatim
Preprocessing.exe -u
\endverbatim

\section gs_features Feature Extraction
The feature extraction tab in CaPTk enables clinicians and other researchers to easily extract feature measurements, commonly used in image analysis, and conduct large-scale analyses in a repeatable manner.

\image latex featurepanel_resize.png "Feature Panel screenshot"

Although the feature panel in CaPTk is continuously expanding, it currently comprises i) intensity-based, ii) textural (GLCM, GLRLM, GLSZM, NGTDM, LBP), and iii) volumetric/morphologic features. You can find the exact list of features incorporated in CaPTk, together with their mathematical definition in the <a href="ht_FeatureExtraction.html">corresponding How-To section</a>.

Specialized applications in CaPTk, such as "EGFRvIII Surrogate Index", "Survival Prediction", "Recurrence Estimator", and "SBRT-Lung" use features of this panel. However, the general idea is to keep the features generic and adaptable for different types of images by just changing the input parameters. Currently we provide some pre-selected parameters for Neuro and Torso images (i.e., Brain, Breast, Lung). Users can alter these pre-selected values through the <b>Custom</b> menu option, or create their own set of parameters via the <b>Advanced</b> menu. The <b>output</b> of the feature extraction tab is a text (<b>.csv</b>) file, with feature names and values. Note that the reported features are extracted per modality, per annotated region and per offset (offset represents the radius around the center pixel; for radius 1, the offset will be +/- 1) value.

\section gs_specializedApps Specialized Applications
Various <a href="ht_SpecialApps.html">Specialized Applications</a> are currently incorporated in CaPTk focusing on brain tumors, breast cancer, and lung nodules as shown in the figure below.

\section gs_commandLineUsage Command Line Usage

Almost every application offered by CaPTk can be used from the command line and utilizing the CaPTk's powerful command line APIs is relatively straight-forward. The following parameters are present in every CLI:

| Laconic | Verbose |                                        Function/Action                                       |
|:-------:|:-------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|    u    |  usage  |              Usage message giving all the possible parameters of an application              |
|    h    |   help  | Help message giving details of parameters (including defaults and ranges) with some examples |
|    v    | version |                          The version information of the application                          |

An example to show the verbose help for an application called <b>${Application}</b>:

| Platform (x64) |                                      Command                                     |
|:--------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|     Windows    |                 ${CaPTk_InstallDir}/bin/${ApplicationName}.exe -h                |
|      Linux     |                   ${CaPTk_InstallDir}/bin/${ApplicationName} -h                  |
|      macOS     | ~/Applications/CaPTk_${version}.app/Contents/Resources/bin/${ApplicationName} -h |

Detailed explanation of using the command line is available in the \ref How_To_Guides.

\section gs_FAQ_2 What DICOM images are currently supported by CaPTk?
  
CaPTk has limited DICOM support. It only supports a limited protocols for MR, CT and MG modalities. DICOM loading has only been tested for images from UPenn. If you are not able to load your DICOM images, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/CBICA/CaPTk/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug-report.md&title=) and send some anonymized DICOM images for us to test.

\section gs_FAQ_3 How do I run CaPTk Applications from the Command Line?


- The full list of command line applications available is shown by running the following command (pretty much every application is available via the command line):
\verbatim
${CaPTk_InstallDir}/bin/CaPTk -h
\endverbatim

- An exemplary scenario to run Applications from the command line (the example shown is to get verbose help):

- There are detailed examples of individual command line usage in the [How To](How_To_Guides.html) section of the documentation.

\section gs_FAQ_4 What are the OpenGL requirements to run CaPTk?

- If CaPTk is unable to load images or you receive the error about minimum OpenGL version wasn't found, please update your display drivers in order to have **OpenGL version 3.2 or above**. Some useful resources:
  - OpenGL update for Ubuntu [[ref](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Ubuntu-16.04-OI-Intel-GL-4.2)]:
\verbatim
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:oibaf/graphics-drivers && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
\endverbatim
  - https://community.khronos.org/t/how-to-update-opengl/75314
  - https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2326268
  - https://www.techwalla.com/articles/how-to-update-opengl-drivers
  - [A reply to a related issue](https://github.com/CBICA/CaPTk/issues/654#issuecomment-543744366):
\verbatim
MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=4.5 #put the opengl version you want to use here
\endverbatim

\section gs_FAQ_5 What if I am having issues with the Linux Installer?

This section highlights some of the common issues on Linux machines.

\subsection gs_FAQ_5_1 FUSE Issues

If the installer successfully finishes and you are not able to run CaPTk due to FUSE issues, please extract the installer using the following command to extract the contents of the AppImage onto the hard drive: 
\verbatim
user@pc:~# ~/CaPTk/${version}/captk --appimage-extract
\endverbatim

- This will extract the package to the path `~/CaPTk/${version}/squashfs-root/usr/` with the binaries present in `~/CaPTk/${version}/squashfs-root/usr/bin`.
- To run **CaPTk** from the command line in this manner, the user would need to make the following additions:
  - Add the path `~/CaPTk/${version}/squashfs-root/usr/lib` to their environment variable **PATH**: `export PATH=~/CaPTk/${version}/squashfs-root/usr/bin:$PATH`
  - Add the path `~/CaPTk/${version}/squashfs-root/usr/lib` to their environment variable **LD_LIBRARY_PATH**: `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/CaPTk/${version}/squashfs-root/usr/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
  - This will need to be present in the user's shell start up file `.bashrc`, `.cshrc`, `.profile`, `.kshrc`, etc.` for the settings to be persistent across login sessions.
  - All the command line applications should now be available for use. For example: 
\verbatim
FeatureExtraction \ # the executable should already be in the $PATH
-n AAC0_timestamp \ # this is the subject ID for this run 
-i /usr/path/T1.nii.gz,/usr/path/T2.nii.gz -t T1,T2 \ # the co-registered input image(s) and their respective modalities
-m /user/path/mask.nii.gz \ # the mask file (co-registered with the input image(s)
-r 2,4,5 -l ED,EN,NE \ # the labels from the mask file from where features need to be extracted and their respective label identifier(s)
-p /usr/path/features.csv \ # the parameter file to use 
-o /usr/path/output.csv # the path to write the output 
\endverbatim
    
\subsection gs_FAQ_5_2 GLIBCXX or GLIBC Issues

- This is happening because the Linux binaries are compiled using the [GCC-4.8 package on Ubuntu 16.04](https://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/gcc-4.8); therefore you will need to update GCC 4.8.5 or newer in order to get CaPTk to work. Some examples are shown:

  - Ubuntu [[ref](https://askubuntu.com/a/581497)]:
\verbatim
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcc-4.9 g++-4.9
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.9 60 --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.9
\endverbatim  

  - CentOS [[ref](https://www.softwarecollections.org/en/scls/user/rhscl/?search=devtoolset&policy=&repo=&order_by=-create_date&per_page=10)]:
\verbatim
sudo yum install centos-release-scl
sudo yum install devtoolset-6
\endverbatim  

- You can still build CaPTk from source using the instructions in [Technical Reference](Technical_Reference.html). Note that you will need a [C++11 compliant compiler](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support#cpp11).

\section gs_FAQ_6 Is there a minimum recommended screen resolution for running CaPTk?
  
The minimum recommended resolution is 1200x1024. We have seen some visualization issues with high DPI (>2K) screens and bug reports related to it will be appreciated.

\section gs_FAQ_7 Where can I find the CaPTk Docker Image? 

You can find all the builds in our Docker Hub repository: https://hub.docker.com/r/cbica/captk

\section gs_FAQ_8 How do I run the CaPTk Docker Image to show the interface?

\verbatim
docker run -it \
  -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
  -v $(pwd)/test:/app \
  -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
  -u qtuser \
  cbica/captk
\endverbatim

\section gs_FAQ_9 What if I am having an issue not listed here?
  
Please [open a new issue](https://github.com/CBICA/CaPTk/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug-report.md&title=) with us and we will do our best to resolve it.
