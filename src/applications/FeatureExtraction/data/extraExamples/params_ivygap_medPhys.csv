Generic,Quantization_Extent,String,Image:ROI,ROI,Whether the quantization of Intensities is supposed to happen on a per-image basis or on a per-ROI basis
Generic,Quantization_Type,String,FixedBinNumber:FixedBinSize:Equal,FixedBinNumber,FixedBinNumber (FBN): the bins are uniformly distributed across the minimum and maximum extent in the ROI/Image as defined under 'Quantization_Extent'; FixedBinSize (FBS): bins are added in a fixed step between the minimum and maximum extent in the ROI/Image as defined under 'Quantization_Extent' the requested size is provided in 'Bins'; Equal: each bin holds an equal number of intensities
Generic,Resampling,mm,0:10,1.0,Resamples all images and masks to this value of voxel/pixel resolution before computations (0: no resampling): reduce this number of more accuracy
Generic,ResamplingInterpolator_Image,mm,Nearest:Linear:BSpline,Linear,Type of interpolator to use if resampling is happening; ignored if m_resamplingResolution = 0
Generic,ResamplingInterpolator_Mask,mm,Nearest:NearestLabel:Linear:BSpline,Nearest,Type of interpolator to use if resampling is happening; ignored if m_resamplingResolution = 0
Generic,SliceComputation,Int,(0:1),0,Controls whether non-Intensity features are calculated along the slice with the largest area along the 3 axes: valid for 3D images only
Generic,WholeImageBinning,Int,(0:1),1,Controls whether the entire image binning happens or just the defined region
Intensity,,,,,
Morphologic,Range,Int,(0:25),0,0:largest connected component in ROI; N: all connected components larger than (N*10^-6) of total image size are taken into account
Morphologic,Feret,Int,(0:1),0,Whether or not to calculate the Feret Diameter (substantially increases computation time)

NGTDM,Offset,String,[Individual:Average],Average,Either individual offset values or averaged
LBP,Radius,Int,(1:9),1:1:3,Radius around the center voxel/pixel (if defined as float it is assumed to be in world coordinates and if as Integer it is assumed to be in image coordinates)
LBP,Neighborhood,Int,0:27,27,The total number of neighbors to consider for computation
LBP,Type,Int,0:3,2,0: original LBP | 1: uniform LBP | 2: rotation invariant LBP | 3: uniform + rotation invariant LBP
