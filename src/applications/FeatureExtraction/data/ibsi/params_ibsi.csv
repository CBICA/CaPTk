Generic,Quantization_Extent,String,Image:ROI,ROI,Whether the quantization of Intensities is supposed to happen on a per-image basis or on a per-ROI basis
Generic,Quantization_Type,String,Uniform:Equal,Uniform,Uniform: the bins are uniformly distributed across the minimum and maximum extent in the ROI/Image as defined under 'Quantization_Extent'; Equal: each bin holds an equal number of intensities
Generic,Resampling,mm,0:10,2.0,Resamples all images and masks to this value of voxel/pixel resolution before computations (0: no resampling): reduce this number of more accuracy
Generic,ResamplingInterpolator_Image,mm,Nearest:Linear:BSpline,Linear,Type of interpolator to use if resampling is happening; ignored if m_resamplingResolution = 0
Generic,ResamplingInterpolator_Mask,mm,Nearest:NearestLabel:Linear:BSpline,Nearest,Type of interpolator to use if resampling is happening; ignored if m_resamplingResolution = 0
Intensity,,,,,
Morphologic,Range,Int,(0:25),0,0:largest connected component in ROI; N: all connected components larger than (N*10^-6) of total image size are taken into account
Volumetric,Dimension,String,[2D:3D],3D,For calculating 2D slice (maximum area along specified axis) or full 3D volume features
Histogram,Bins,Int,,32,The number of bins to calculate for the Histogram
GLCM,Bins,Int,,32,
GLCM,Radius,Int,(1:9),1,Radius around the center voxel which can be in mm as well (needs to be defined as float in same space as input image/mask)
GLCM,Offset,String,[Individual:Average:Combined],Average,Either individual offset values or averagedcomputation for individual offsets might not work)

NGLDM,Radius,Int,(1:9),1,Radius around the center voxel
NGLDM,Offset,String,[Individual:Average],Average,Either individual offset values or averaged
LBP,Radius,Int,(1:9),1,Radius around the center voxel/pixel (if defined as float it is assumed to be in world coordinates and if as Integer it is assumed to be in image coordinates)
LBP,Neighborhood,Int,0:27,27,The total number of neighbors to consider for computation
LBP,Type,Int,0:3,2,0: original LBP | 1: uniform LBP | 2: rotation invariant LBP | 3: uniform + rotation invariant LBPhaving same value as center pixel and None disregards the patch
