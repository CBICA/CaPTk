Generic,Quantization_Extent,String,Image:ROI,ROI,Whether the quantization of Intensities is supposed to happen on a per-image basis or on a per-ROI basis
Generic,Quantization_Type,String,FixedBinNumber:FixedBinSize:Equal,FixedBinNumber,FixedBinNumber (FBN): the bins are uniformly distributed across the minimum and maximum extent in the ROI/Image as defined under 'Quantization_Extent'; FixedBinSize (FBS): bins are added in a fixed step between the minimum and maximum extent in the ROI/Image as defined under 'Quantization_Extent' the requested size is provided in 'Bins'; Equal: each bin holds an equal number of intensities
Generic,Resampling,mm,0:10,1.0,Resamples all images and masks to this value of voxel/pixel resolution before computations (0: no resampling): reduce this number of more accuracy
Generic,ResamplingInterpolator_Image,mm,Nearest:Linear:BSpline,Linear,Type of interpolator to use if resampling is happening; ignored if m_resamplingResolution = 0
Generic,ResamplingInterpolator_Mask,mm,Nearest:NearestLabel:Linear:BSpline,Nearest,Type of interpolator to use if resampling is happening; ignored if m_resamplingResolution = 0
Generic,SliceComputation,Int,(0:1),0,Controls whether non-Intensity features are calculated along the slice with the largest area along the 3 axes: valid for 3D images only
Generic,NaN-Handling,String,Keep:Remove,Keep,Specify how to handle features with NaN values 'Remove' removes the feature from output - keep in mind this might cause issues with output file in multi-subject (i.e. Training/Batch) mode

LBP,Neighborhood,Int,0:27,27,The total number of neighbors to consider for computation
LBP,Type,Int,0:3,2,0: original LBP | 1: uniform LBP | 2: rotation invariant LBP | 3: uniform + rotation invariant LBP
Collage,Radius,Int,(1:9),1,Radius around the center voxel/pixel (if defined as float it is assumed to be in world coordinates and if as Integer it is assumed to be in image coordinates); currently disabled for lattice computation
Collage,Bins,Int,,20,The number of bins (FBN) or size of each bin (FBS) to calculate for the Histogram
Lattice,FullImage,Int,0:1,0,Whether computations across the entire image need to happen in addition to lattice
Lattice,Window,mm,0:ImageSize,6.3,Window of single lattice node (number based on experiments by CBIG) - should be same as Step for non-overlapping tiles
Lattice,Step,mm,0:ImageSize,6.3,Step size to increase for consecutive lattice node (number based on experiments by CBIG) - should be same as Step for non-overlapping tiles
Lattice,Boundary,String,[NoPadding:ZeroPadding:FluxNeumann],NoPadding,The boundary condition to use for lattice construction
Lattice,PatchBoundary,String,[Full:ROI:None],Full,Full considers all non-zero pixels and adds weight whereas ROI considers only the indeces having same value as center pixel and None disregards the patch
