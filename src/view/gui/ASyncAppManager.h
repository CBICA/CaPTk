\class ASyncAppManager

\brief Class is templated over the Application class

This class is used for running application in an asynchronous manner. The application should have inherited properties from
the class 'BaseClass', which gives ASyncAppManager access to a few pre-defined functions for easy synchronization. This class 
uses QThread for syncing between the GUI and processing class.
