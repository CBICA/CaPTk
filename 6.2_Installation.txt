\page Installation Installation Instructions

## Windows

- Download the ".msi" installer file and double click to open.
- On Windows 10, sometimes, Microsoft Edge does not let you download installers from unknown sources for security purposes (the warning comes up after the download finishes); you will need to select "Keep File" and follow prompts.
- If a security prompt comes up after opening the installer, click on "Run Anyway".
- Follow prompts for installation.

## Linux

- Linux users have a CaPTk AppImage available called `CaPTk_${Version}.bin`. 
- To run the AppImage, first open a terminal in the same directory as the .bin file.
- You will want to make sure it is runnable as an executable with the following command:
\verbatim
chmod +x CaPTk_${Version}.bin
\endverbatim
- To install CaPTk to the current directory where the AppImage was downloaded, run the following command:
\verbatim
./CaPTk_${Version}.bin
\endverbatim
- To specify a preferred directory to install CaPTk, run the following command:
\verbatim
./CaPTk_${Version}.bin --target {path_to_preferred_directory}
\endverbatim
- Follow prompts to install.

## macOS

- Users will download the ".pkg" file from NITRC; double-click the file. 
- If there is a window saying that this is an "unidentified developer", hit "OK" and then go to "System Preferences > Security and Privacy" and you need to click on "Open Anyway" beside the "CaPTk_$version.pkg" (this will prompt for your password).
- Double click on the pkg file and click on "Open". This will guide you through the installation screen with licensing information.
- Before installation begins, you may be prompted for your password again.
- You will find CaPTk under your "Applications" folder and you can delete the disk image.
